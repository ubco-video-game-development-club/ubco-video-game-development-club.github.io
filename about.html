          The UBCO Video Game Development Club is the best place to learn about and participate in game development at
          the University of British Columbia Okanagan. It is run by some of UBCO's finest students, all of which are
          passionate about the art of game development and love to teach, learn, and collaborate. Throughout the school
          year, we run events to encourage people to make video games, play video games, and overall have fun. Don't
          know how to make a video game, but want to learn? You're welcome here as well! We run workshops and other
          events to help people learn how to make games, and have an amazing mentorship program to help you along the
          way.
