  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>
    The UBCO Video Game Development Club is the best place to learn about and participate in game development at the University of British Columbia Okanagan.
    It is run by some of UBCO's finest students, all of which are passionate about the art of game development and love to teach, learn, and collaborate. Throughout
    the school year, we run events to encourage people to make video games, play video games, and overall have fun. Don't know how to make a video game, but
    want to learn? You're welcome here as well! We run workshops and other events to help people learn how to make games, and have an amazing mentorship program
    to help you along the way.
